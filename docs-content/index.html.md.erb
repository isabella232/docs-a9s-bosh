## <id="overview"></a>Overview

a9s data services, such as a9s MongoDB for PCF, use a9s BOSH for PCF to create on-demand provisioning of
service instances that are represented by dedicated virtual machines or clusters of virtual machines.

This service uses the default open source version of BOSH. a9s does not modify BOSH at all.
Therefore, there is no vendor lock-in.
