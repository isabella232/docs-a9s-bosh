title: a9s BOSH for PCF Use Case
owner: Partners
---

<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
Before installing an a9s service tile (e.g. a9s MongoDB for PCF), the <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b> and <b>a9s Consul for PCF</b> tile must be installed.
</div>

The a9s BOSH for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile is used by all a9s service tiles for on-demand provisioning and lifecycle management of dedicated virtual machines. Consequently, each service instance will run on one or more dedicated virtual machines to provide a solid isolation.

Whenever a PCF end user creates a new service instance, for example by executing:

<code>cf create-service a9s-mongodb32 mongodb-cluster-small mydb</code>,
<code>cf create-service a9s-postgresql94 postgresql-single-small mydb</code><br/>
etc.

the corresponding a9s service tile will talk to the <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b> tile and create a BOSH deployment in order to provision virtual machines and to install the required software packages.

## Advantages of Using a9s BOSH for PCF

Even though only a few services tiles are uploaded in your <b>PCF Ops Manager Director</b>,
they can spawn many service instances depending on your users' needs.
This can lead to a series of problems:

* __Bottleneck:__ The <b>PCF Ops Manager Director</b> might take too long to
execute a task for the Data Service because it is handling tasks from thousands
of service instances.

* __Upgrade Side Effects:__ If something goes wrong when upgrading the <b>PCF
  Ops Manager Director</b>, the service instances could be affected.

* __Limited Configuration:__ The <b>Ops Manager Director</b> only allows a limited
range of configuration options. The <b>a9s Bosh Director for PCF</b> extends those
options to provide more fine-grained configuration.

* __Confusing Environment:__ The instances created by the service share the same space
as the tiles, however the <b>Ops Manager</b> does not reflect this properly.

With <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b>, it is possible to provide a completely different target
environment for the service instances.

This approach has the main advantage of decoupling the lifecycle management of
the run time from the service instances providing a more robust and specialized
environment for the services.

With <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b>, it is possible to have:

* __Separated Resources:__ Service instance tasks are executed by the <b>a9s BOSH
for PCF</b> while the <b>PCF Ops Manager Director</b> handles tasks regarding the
service.

* __Safe Upgrades:__ <b>Ops Manager</b> upgrades do not affect <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b>,
so it can be done safely.

* __Fine-Grained Configuration:__ Freedom to provide a different configuration to
handle specially the service instances. This way, applying changes to <b>PCF Ops
Manager Director</b> can be done without data loss.

* __Clear Separation:__ The service instances are always in <b>a9s BOSH for PCF</b>
and the services are always in <b>PCF Ops Manager Director</b>. There aren't any
hidden or mixed releases, deployments, instances, etc.

* __IaaS Portability:__ A completely different IaaS to provide service instances.
